Siebel Script Editor is a Visual Studio Code extension, which enables editing several Siebel objects in VS Code. This is a historical repository created for the test release of the first public binary release. The extension can now be installed through the VS Code Extension marketplace directly.

The extension is now available at our [siebelScriptsEditor](https://github.com/endoit/siebelScriptsEditor) repository with full source code. If you are looking for this historical release which used direct database access (not recommended), please check the [directdb_archive](https://github.com/endoit/siebelScriptsEditor/tree/directdb_archive) branch.

Thanks for your testing and feedback.
